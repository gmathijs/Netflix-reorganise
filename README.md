# netflix reorganise history

Anyone can download their NETFLIX viewing history from their profile. You get a a CSV file which you can open with Excel or Numbers (on Mac)

This project is more for me to be get aquinted with Visual Code python and using github.
The list which Netflix creates has a lot of data and for series each episode is given. I just want to see the series name and the movie name.

The python code (netflix_rerganise_history.py) reads the standard netflix file called NetflixViewingHistory.csv and outputs a csv file 
called NetflixViewingHistory_out.csv.


I have addded a column called type, so you can filter. For each serie the serie name is given.

Todo: I want each serie listed followed by season number
